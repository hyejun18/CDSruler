# CDSruler

This portable tool will be calculate the length of CDS and UTR from genePred table of UCSC table browser.
This was especially designed for NCBI RefSeq.

Usage : python3 CDSruler.py file(input, not gzipped) file(output, not gzipped)

The total length, 5′ UTR, CDS length and 3′ UTR length of each transcript will be calculated in extended columns: tx_len, UTR5_len, CDS_len and UTR3_len.
